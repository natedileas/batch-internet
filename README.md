caching thing

need:

a way to save static content for offline viewing

browser extension? this would give a ui and a viewer.

would need save (with compression?) and reload capability

auto-save vs click to save

would be cool to do a smart/learning save thing. let it download as much as can be (with cap) and then see what actually gets recalled / revisited. improve saving over time. periodically refresh.

index stuff I care about? I feel like this would be guessable from browsing history (generate whitelist, read a blacklist from somewhere else.)

history tree?s

might be fun to pretend that I'm "far away" from the internet, so this is kind of an internet dump being sent across space or something.
- need lists of things to save
- need bandwidth limits
- need scheduling
